# Student Lifestyle Analysis

## Project Overview

The **Student Lifestyle Analysis** project focuses on examining the impact of students' lifestyle habits on stress levels, academic performance (GPA), sleep hours, and physical activity. Using data collected from students, I conducted data exploration, correlation analysis, and built predictive models to better understand the factors influencing students' lives.

The primary goal of the project was to create a predictive model for students' stress levels. Ultimately, the project achieved **94% accuracy** in predicting stress, demonstrating the robustness of the applied analytical methods and models.

## Project Results

### 1. Predictive Model

- Best model: **k-Nearest Neighbors**
- Achieved accuracy: **94%**
- Key factors influencing stress:
  - Number of sleep hours
  - Level of physical activity
  - GPA performance

### 2. Correlation Between Features

The heatmap below illustrates the correlations between variables such as stress, physical activity, sleep hours, and GPA. Interestingly, **lower stress levels are strongly correlated with worse academic performance**, highlighting the importance of maintaining a balanced lifestyle.

### 3. Individual Student Analysis

The following visualizations showcase one of the most surprising students in the dataset:
1. This student spends **the least amount of time studying**, yet achieves one of the highest GPAs among all participants.
2. Despite having **low stress levels**, the student maintains outstanding academic performance.

#### Example:
